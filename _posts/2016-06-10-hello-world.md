# Hello World!

Welcome to my very first blog. Lets learn to code together.

Welcome to my summer blog! It has been a long standing goal of mine to really master a programming language. To date I have some experience coding in Java, and a little experience writing code in Python and R. I'm in no way a "good" programmer, but that's what this blog is for. Every day, after work, I will sit down for at least an hour to work on something (mainly projects in python) and upload the work here when I finish. The goal:

* Learn, Practice, and Refine new programming skills
* Help others Learn, Practice, and Refine programming skills
* Build a community with both new and experienced programmers
* Most of all...Have Fun (and help_the grid_ beta-test)

As a disclaimer I want to remind you, the reader, I am by any means no expert. I'm just a student like many of you and I want to document my learning experience. Stay tuned for more content.
